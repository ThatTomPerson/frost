# Frost

Frost is a super fast multi platform package downloader

## NOT PRODUCTION READY


## Package Downloader vs Package Manager

A Package Manager does everything from searching, installing, managing updates and versioning

A Package Downloader does only that, It looks at the package managers lockfiles and downloads all of the packages

## Why
To reduce CI Build times, it uses an efficent cache and is highly concurent

## Supported Package Managers
 - Composer
 - more to come

## Install 
### Mac
```
brew tap thattomperson/tap
brew install frost

## Why Frost
idk, it never updates state so it is cold?, I'm not good at names
